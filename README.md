# ECE243 - Computer Organization & Assembly Language Programming

This second-year course focuses on fundamental aspects of computer architecture, covering topics such as central processing unit design, hardwired control, input-output mechanisms, interrupt handling, assembly language programming, main memory organization, cache structures, peripherals, interfacing techniques, and system design principles. The accompanying laboratory component includes hands-on experiments with logic systems and microprocessors, emphasizing design activities as a significant part of the practical work, culminating in an open-ended project.

## Lab 1: Introduction to Assembly Language Programming, CPULator, and the Monitor Program

Explore the fundamentals of Assembly Language programming, CPULator simulation, and the Monitor Program in Lab 1. Gain hands-on experience with the Nios II processor on the DE1-SoC Computer. Learn the essentials of program development, simulator utilization, and in-lab hardware interactions.

## Lab 2: Accessing Memory, Loops, Conditional Branches

Dive deeper into Assembly Language programming in Lab 2. Explore memory access, loop structures, and conditional branches. Enhance your skills in program development and gain a comprehensive understanding of real-time execution on the DE1-SoC board. Engage in hands-on interactions with the Monitor Program for a holistic learning experience.

## Lab 3: Logic Instructions, Subroutines and Memory Mapped Output

The goal of this lab is to cover the following concepts/skills: using the logic and shift instructions to access single
bits, understanding how to make a subroutine, and how transfer of control works, as well as parameter passing,
what memory-mapped output is, and an introduction to time in the form of software delay loops. This, together
with practice in basic assembly programming, accessing memory through loads and stores and those crucial de-
bugging skills that are the key pathway to becoming an engineer!

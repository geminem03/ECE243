# ECE243 - Computer Organization & Assembly Language Programming

This second-year course focuses on fundamental aspects of computer architecture, covering topics such as central processing unit design, hardwired control, input-output mechanisms, interrupt handling, assembly language programming, main memory organization, cache structures, peripherals, interfacing techniques, and system design principles. The accompanying laboratory component includes hands-on experiments with logic systems and microprocessors, emphasizing design activities as a significant part of the practical work, culminating in an open-ended project.

## Lab 1: Introduction to Assembly Language Programming, CPULator, and the Monitor Program

Explore the fundamentals of Assembly Language programming, CPULator simulation, and the Monitor Program in Lab 1. Gain hands-on experience with the Nios II processor on the DE1-SoC Computer. Learn the essentials of program development, simulator utilization, and in-lab hardware interactions.

## Lab 2: Accessing Memory, Loops, Conditional Branches

Dive deeper into Assembly Language programming in Lab 2. Explore memory access, loop structures, and conditional branches. Enhance your skills in program development and gain a comprehensive understanding of real-time execution on the DE1-SoC board. Engage in hands-on interactions with the Monitor Program for a holistic learning experience.

## Lab 3: Logic Instructions, Subroutines and Memory Mapped Output

The goal of this lab is to cover the following concepts/skills: using the logic and shift instructions to access single
bits, understanding how to make a subroutine, and how transfer of control works, as well as parameter passing,
what memory-mapped output is, and an introduction to time in the form of software delay loops. This, together
with practice in basic assembly programming, accessing memory through loads and stores and those crucial de-
bugging skills that are the key pathway to becoming an engineer!

## Lab 4: Memory Mapped I/O, Polling and Timer

The goal of this lab is to explore the use of devices that provide input and output capabilities for a processor, and
to see how a processor connects to those inputs and outputs, through the Memory Mapped method. You’ll also
be introduced to a device that has a special purpose in computer systems, the Timer, which is used for precise
measurement and allocation of time within the computer

## Lab 5: Hex Displays and Interrupt-Driven Input/Output

Interrupt-driven I/O is a fundamental way that all processors synchronize with the outside world. The goal of this
lab is to understand the use of interrupts for the NIOS II processor, using assembly-language code, and to get some
practice with subroutines, modularity, and learning how to use the HEX displays on the DE1-SoC.

## Lab 6: Coding in C and Audio Input and Output
The goal of this lab is to become comfortable with using the C programming language to do “embedded system”
input/output, which you have been doing up to now using the Nios II Assembly Language. We will begin my
doing something very similar to previous labs, except in C. Then we’ll move on to a more complex input/output
device: sound input and output.

## Lab 7: Introduction to Graphics and Animation
The goal of this lab is to learn how to display images and perform animation, written in the C language for
the DE1-SoC Computer. Graphics can be displayed by connecting a VGA monitor to the video-out port on the
board. You can also use CPUlator to develop and debug graphics code - graphics that would normally appear on
a VGA display are instead rendered inside a sub-window, labeled VGA pixel buffer, within CPUlator. This
subwindow can be set to various sizes and it can also be “popped out” of the main browser window, if desired.
